/**
 * iven a binary tree where every node has a unique value, and a target key k, 
 * find the value of the nearest leaf node to target k in the tree.If there are multiple cases, return to the leftmost leaf node.

    Here, nearest to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. 
    Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.
    
    1.root represents a binary tree with at least 1 node and at most 1000 nodes.
    2.Every node has a unique node.val in range [1, 1000].
    3.There exists some node in the given binary tree for which node.val == k.

    Example
    Example 1:
    
    Given:
    root = {1, 3, 2}, k = 1
    Diagram of binary tree:
              1
             / \
            3   2
    
    Return: 3
    
    Explanation: Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.3 is the leftmost leaf node.
    Example 2:
    
    Given:
    root = {1}, k = 1
    Return: 1
    
    Explanation: The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.
    Example 3:
    
    Given:
    root = {1,2,3,4,#,#,#,5,#,6}, k = 2
    Diagram of binary tree:
                 1
                / \
               2   3
              /
             4
            /
           5
          /
         6
    
    Return: 3
    Explanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.
